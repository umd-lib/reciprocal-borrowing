          The institutions listed below agree to provide reciprocal borrowing
          privileges to current faculty, emeritus faculty, students, and staff
          at the other Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA) member libraries.
          Borrowing privileges are governed by the lending library based on
          local circulation policies established for guest borrowers. To make
          use of this service, borrowers must present an institutional photo ID
          and verify their current affiliation by authenticating through use of
          this BTAA Reciprocal Borrowing Application.
