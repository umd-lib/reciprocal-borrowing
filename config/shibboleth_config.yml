# This YAML file contains Shibboleth configuration information for the
# production, development, and test Rails environments.
#
# The Rails application will need to be restarted to pick up any modifications
# to this file.

# Production Environment Configuration
production:
  # The "organizations" map contains information for each organization available
  # to the application.
  #
  # Each entry in the "organizations" map MUST adhere to the following form:
  #
  #   <org_code>:
  #     code: <org_code>
  #     name: <human-readable name of the organization>
  #     idp_entity_id: <entityId for the organization's IDP>
  #     display_order: <number used to sort entries>
  #
  # The <org_code> must be unique, and the "code" field of the entry must
  # match the <org_code> of the entry. This will typically be the taken from
  # the idp_entity_id.
  #
  # The "idp_entity_id" should contain the entityID of the organization's IDP.
  # One source of this information is:
  #
  #    https://www.incommon.org/federation/info/all-entities.html
  #
  # Select the organzation, then select "more technical information" link in
  # the dialog to see the entityID.
  #
  # The "display_order" number is only used to determine the order in which
  # the entries are displayed in a list to the user.
  #
  # YAML anchors (&id_<org_code>) are used to facilitate reuse the entries
  # in the "development" and "test" environments.
